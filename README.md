# Simple AI Based Website Tester

A modular Python project that uses AI (Groq) and Selenium to automatically test websites. Users can provide natural language instructions like:

> "Test login on https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login with username 'tomsmith' and password 'SuperSecretPassword!'"

The AI converts these instructions into structured test steps, executes them in a headless browser, and explains the results in plain English.
